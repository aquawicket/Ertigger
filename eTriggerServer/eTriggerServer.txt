----
*Sometimes connected pc's close eTrigger and the socket on the server remains open. Need to kill it if duplicate found,
 use connected time to diconnect old duplicate.

TODO
----
*Add "connected time" to info.
*Add a seperate Thread for transmitions between client.
*Add variable to track the time each client has been connected.
*Add variable to track clients version of eTrigger.
